# Restaurant Listing CRM Project

This is a Django-based project that allows users to view a list of restaurants, log in, add new restaurants, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on restaurant entries.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed (you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip package manager installed (usually comes with Python)
- MySQL installed and configured

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-listing-crm.git
cd restaurant-listing-crm
```


### Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
### Install Dependencies
- Create a MySQL database for your project.
- Update the database settings in settings.py:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',  # Or your database host
        'PORT': '',           # 3306 for default MySQL port
    }
}
```
 - Apply migrations to create the database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Create a Superuser (Admin)

You can create an admin user who can add, update, and delete restaurants through the Django admin interface.
 ```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The development server will start, and you can access the project in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Usage
- Access the restaurant listing at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
- Log in with your superuser credentials at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to access the admin panel for CRUD operations on restaurants.
- Creating an account is required to make changes (CRUD) in restaurant list.
